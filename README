simple computation of Cl_yy 
by Samuel Flender

this code computes the 1-halo term of the y-y auto power spectrum:

Cl_yy = int dz dV/dz/dOmega int dM dn/dM (y_ell(M,z))^2

which is mathematically equivalent to 

Cl_yy = (1/(4*pi)) sum_ij DeltaN(M_i,z_j) y_ell(M_i,z_j)^2

where DeltaN is the binned halo count on the lightcone.

The DeltaN_i,j components are counted in the lightcone simulation which needs to be provided as input parameter.
